                    Siberian tigers are distinguishable by their
                    striped fur. Similar to people’s unique fingerprints, no two
                    tigers have the same striped pattern.

                    The Amur tiger, also known as Siberian
                    tiger, is the largest cat in the world. They are solitary animals,
                    marking heir scent on trees to keep other tigers away. They
                    stalk their prey, which include elk, boar, bears, and deer,
                    until they are close enough to pounce. When successful, they
                    drag their kill to a secluded area before devouring the meat.
